            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> During the adminiſtration of Covenant in the times of the Old Teſtament, the natural iſſue of Gods people, before they acted their faith, even as ſoon as they were born, were within the Covenant. The form of the Promiſe is, <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed:</hi> Circumciſion the Seal of the righteouſneſs of faith, was ſet in their fleſh at eight days old.

Chaſtiſeth their ſin, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.2. And Chriſt calls the Jews natural, the <hi>children of his Kingdom,</hi> and placeth in them the Right to the mercies he brought, whilſt the Gentiles were <hi>Dogs licking up the crums.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But what is the intereſt of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants in the Old Teſtament to us under the new?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Very much; for whilſt we ſee they have been in Covenant, it will direct us to ſee a very clear <hi>reverſal</hi> and plain limitation of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant before we part with ſuch a <hi>birth-right and priviledge;</hi> for common Juſtice will not ſuffer us without good warrant to change a Fee-farm to our ſelves and heirs, for a Leaſe for term of Life; and we need a clear reaſon to convert the Jews from the old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, whereby they begot an <hi>holy ſeed</hi> to God, unto a ſtraiter Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that provides for the Parent, but leaves the child prophane, and eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to God. The enemies of our Baptiſm, cry for an expreſs command
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:172229:17"/> to baptize Infants; but inſtead of ſhewing any, we think we have good reaſon to ſay, we as ſuch infants, have by a long Tenure an intereſt in the Covenant; ſhew us a clear Goſpel Writ of Ejection, if you think now to diſpoſſeſs us.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But have you any good ground in the New Teſtament on which infants, as the natural iſſue of believing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents may claim an intereſt in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes, very much, when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider little ſucking Babes brought in arms to be received by the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus to be bleſſed by him, to be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red members of the Kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, propounded as ſuch who ought to be received in his name, as his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and not to be offended; all which are the bleſsings of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: and that the Apoſtle affirms of the <hi>Gentiles ingrafted in,</hi> as well as the <hi>Jews cut off,</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. That if the firſt-fruits, then the whole lump is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; if the root, then the branches are holy; and the branches do partake of the fatneſs of the olive: we muſt caſt away our reaſons if we ſee not

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes, the Apoſtle doth expreſly ſay the Infants of one Chriſtian Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent is holy, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 7.14. of <hi>real holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs none underſtand it; natural holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. the Apoſtle ſaith expreſly, <hi>The promiſe is to you, and to your children:</hi> This promiſe cannot be of extraordinary-Gifts, becauſe it is extended to all that ſhall be called; nor is it to children <hi>when culled,</hi> for that were not to them as <hi>children:</hi> the Holy Ghoſt doth not uſe to ſpeak non-ſenſe, and expreſs perſonal quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications by terms of relation, but tels the believer, his children as his children have a priviledge in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant above other mens children; ſo that it is plain ſuch Infants are within the Covenant, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their capacity to enjoy
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:172229:18"/> the Seals and Priviledges thereof.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But they are not capable of being baptized, becauſe they can act nothing in the Ordi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Nor is ſuch capacity needfull; for profeſsion gives no right to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, but as an evidence of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Intereſt: and their right to the Covenant, manifeſted by their <hi>deſcent from ſuch Parents</hi> is as good a reaſon for their Baptiſm: and the ſubjects of the initiating Seal do not act any thing, as if God would thereby di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate, inability to action ſhall be no bar to Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But thoſe we read of in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture that were baptized were at grown years.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> So were thoſe who were firſt circumciſed; but that was occaſional and circumſtancial: The Church is founded in grown Trees, but is to be edified by infant branches.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But there is no inſtitution for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Baptiſm.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> That Baptiſm is inſtituted, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied. Age or Infancy are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly directions to whom to apply it, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:172229:18"/> therein the qualification of <hi>Covenant Intereſt</hi> is according to Scripture the clear direction. Moreover Infants may be Diſciples, bearing on them the name of Chriſt, and are Members of Nations, and ſo the Inſtitution, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the baptizing of Diſcipled Nations, is to them extended.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>But all you urge for infants bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, is by way of inference and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Scripture-Inference is Gods word, binding mans conſcience: it was the way of Chriſt his convincing the Sadduces of the Reſurrection, and of <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching at <hi>Athens,</hi> and is your only way to warrant womens Communion at the Lords Table, and ſhall it not be of force to Infants Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm?</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What benefit do you receive by your Baptiſm?</hi>
            </p>

            <p>Q. <hi>Is then Baptiſm the neceſſary qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification for approach to God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yes, it is ſo neceſſary that the unbaptized, may not appear in the Aſſemblies of his people. The way of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:172229:19"/> Chriſt his appearance in his Church as the Meſsiah was prepared by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; therefore <hi>John</hi> the promiſed <hi>Elias,</hi> is called <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt.</hi> Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm prepared Chriſt for his work of Mediatorſhip; he neither prayed (that we read of) nor was tempted, nor preached, nor received the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony from heaven till he was bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed; and if the head were thus ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, much more muſt the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: moreover Circumciſion did ſanctifie ſuch as might come nigh to the Sanctuary, and Baptiſm hath ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in the room, ſignifies and ſeals the ſame Grace, and in all things ſerve to the ſame end in the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church, that Circumciſion did to the Jews.</p>

Baptiſm is in its nature and efficacy the ſame to all, but by reaſon of the incapacity of ſome it is not always a like effectual.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What principles or practices are to be condemned as contrary to this uſe of Baptiſm?</hi>

Such as dictate to the unbaptized a liberty of acceſs to God; teaching that Baptiſm is not the ground of Communion with the Church viſible, but real Grace, the anſwer of a good conſcience, and thereon do tender all the Ordinances to the unbaptized, which is directly oppoſite to this uſe of the Ordinance, and inverts the Ordinance of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, giving God cauſe to complain, as once in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Ezek. 44.7. <hi>Ye have defiled my Sanctuary by admitting into my Sanctuary the unbaptized in fleſh and in ſpirit.</hi>

               <hi>A.</hi> Infant Baptiſm <hi>expreſſeth clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſin of nature,</hi> and engageth againſt it: in that we are waſhed, it is evident we are unclean, but being ſo ſoon baptized, doth witneſs our very nature is defiled; for infancy did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver admit us to be ſtained with perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal guilt as are men at years; and ſo Infant Baptiſm is an unanſwerable ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of our inbred corruption a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which we are bound to fight, being baptized before it had ſpread it ſelf into actual ſin.</p>

            </p>
            <p>A. It <hi>encourageth under death;</hi> the knowledge of the Covenant, extended unto Believers and their ſeed, hath prepared young children unto Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and intereſt in the Covenant can be the only ground of hope to the Parents under the death of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, who are born the children of wrath, but by Baptiſm are put into

            <p>Q. <hi>May not theſe benefits redound to ſuch as are baptized in grown years?</hi>

               </gap>ty, by way of alluſion unto Baptiſme: the difference is not much, for if all Externall Sanctity be here intended, then <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> and if the order of Sanctity be to be obſerved, <hi>that firſt,</hi> as it where External San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity muſt begin, yet my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:172229:27" rendition="simple:additions"/> leads me to the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Antients, and ſuch later Expoſitors as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their ſteps; and ſo I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by the body waſhed with pure water, <hi>the Perſon Baptized</hi> or qualified by due ſubjection to the Sacrament of Baptiſme, and hereunto I am guided 1. <hi>by the oppoſition of it, to the heart ſprinkled,</hi> which intends the reall Sanctification of the whole Man; and is ſo interpreted in the 9 ch. 14. v. whilſt the waſhing of the body ſignified Externall Sanctification, alwayes in uſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jewes, and is ſo uſed by the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.26. <hi>Sanctified by the waſhing of water;</hi> as Expoſitors do agree. So the oppoſition in this Text ſeems to me, to diſtinguiſh the inward grace, and outward ſigne in dictating the Goſpell
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:172229:28"/> order of acceſs to God, <hi>to be by Baptiſme of water on the body and blood, or Grace on the heart:</hi> and is the ſame with that in 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 3.21. <hi>Baptiſme that now is, ſaves us, not the waſhing of water, but the anſwer of a good Conſcience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>By the occaſion,</hi> which ſeemes to me to have been the preventing anſwer of an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, that might well be propounded by the Jewes thus; <q>You have put a period to all holy Rites, and laid all the Adminiſtrations of the Covenant according to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the duſt, and tell us poſitively that they which <hi>ſerve the Tabernacle muſt not eat at your</hi> Altar, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 13.10.) nor enjoy with you the Priviledges of Grace; we well know <hi>God is a Holy God, and will be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
<pb facs="tcp:172229:28"/> in ſuch as approach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him;</hi> and the <hi>uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in heart or in fleſh</hi> may not come nigh unto him, <hi>Ezek</hi> 44.9. nor enter into his Sanctuary; what order or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ordinance of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is then preſcribed in our approaches to God?</q> To which the Apoſtle anſwereth, in ſtead of Circumciſion of heart and fleſh under the old, you muſt according to the direction of the New Covenant and the Goſpell worſhip, draw near to God <hi>with an heart ſprinkled from an evil Conſcience, and a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy waſhed with pure water,</hi> which will be to you a ground <hi>of full aſſurance,</hi> which all the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Law could not Create unto you. So that the words ſeem not to me to be at all ſtrained: but of their own
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:172229:29"/> ſelves by a genuine Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, thus to ſpeak, that the <hi>outward ſigne and inward Grace of Baptiſme</hi> are the onely qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications of ſuch as will in full aſſurance of Faith draw nigh to God in Goſpell adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the priviledges of the new Covenant; and in this ſenſe and expoſition I ſtand not alone, for <hi>Aretius</hi> ſaith expreſſely, <hi>Corpora Noſtra de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent eſſe abluta aqua pura, hoc eſt, Baptiſme Chriſti debemus eſſe initiati: Our bodies waſhed with pure water, that is, we ought to be initiated by the Baptiſme of Chriſts appointment.</hi> And <hi>Paraeus</hi> ſaith <hi>Intelligimus nos intus ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine &amp; ſpiritu Chriſti purgari, foris quod Baptiſmo ablui corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus: ad Sacramentum enim Baptiſmi Apoſtolus reſpicere vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detur:</hi> Par. in Loc. <hi>We under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:172229:29"/> an inward ſprinkling of the Conſcience with the Blood and Spirit of Chriſt, and an outward waſhing the body by Baptiſme; for the Apoſtle lookes on Baptiſme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The words thus explained, do plainly preſent to our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and conſideration, this point of Doctrine.</p>
            <p>Doctr. <hi>Baptiſme, or waſhing of the Body with pure water, is a ſpecial qualification that fits us for confident approach to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the proſecution of this Doctrine, I ſhall explaine, confirme, and apply it with all convenient brevity.</p>
            <p>In the explication we are to enquire what is Baptiſme?</p>
            <p n="2">2. What 'tis to approach to God with confidence?</p>
            <p>For the firſt, I ſhall not ſtand upon the acceptations of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:172229:30"/> word Baptiſme, nor trouble you with the various ſenſes in which 'tis uſed: but taking it in its vulgar acceptation, as it denominates a Goſpell or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance and eminent piece of Gods worſhip, you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of it this deſcription.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Baptiſme is a Solemn and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious application of water, by a lawfull Miniſter to a fit Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; to the ſignifying of the Blood of Chriſt, and its clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiing property, and the Sealing of the Covenant of Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this deſcription I will not trouble you with a logicall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of it, into its parts: but propound theſe concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as helpfull to your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of it.</p>
            <p>Concluſion 1. <hi>Water is the outward ſign and matter of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme;</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:172229:30"/> water and no other Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; pure water without Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh mixture, or Compoſition with oyle, creame, ſpittle, or the like; for this and this only Element the Lord appointed, and his appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſtamps on the uſe of it, <hi>Dignity and Authority,</hi> and juſtly checks the curioſity of ſuch as are ſubject to contemne the ſimplicity of the Element, and advance the dignity of the Ordinance by their own dull, but daring inventions: and yet water being an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, cooling heat, quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thirſt, of common uſe, and eaſie purchaſe, and cleanſing all filthineſs; doth fitly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto our minds the cooling and refreſhing efficacy, the plenty and eaſie purchaſe, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the purifying pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:172229:31"/> of the Blood of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Concluſ. 2. <hi>A ſolemne and Religious application of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter muſt be the form of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme;</hi> That water be applied to the Subject is the eſſentiall act of Baptiſme, the manner of its application, <hi>by dipping or ſprinkling,</hi> is to be guided by diſcretion and conveniency; though we deny not <hi>dipping</hi> to have been uſed in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Churches, in the hot Eaſtern Countries, where with ſafety and conveniency it might be uſed; and we grant (all other things concurring) <hi>dipping</hi> to be a lawfull application of the water, yet it is not eſſentially and indiſpenſably neceſſary, as the Anabaptiſts do too zealouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contend: but it is both law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ſufficient that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be <hi>poured or ſprinkled</hi> on
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:172229:31"/> the Subject which hath been the allowed practiſe of the Church; and the word <hi>Baptize, ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> any kind of waſhing, by ſprinkling, pouring on, or dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping: and the meaſure, or quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of water being no more eſſentiall to Baptiſme then of Bread and Wine to the Lords Supper, will allow it; and the Holy Ghoſt mentioneth the blood of Chriſt as Cleanſing by <hi>ſprinkling</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. by way of alluſion to this act in Baptiſme, as the analogie thereof: and it is more then probable that Baptiſme in hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as was that of the Jaylors, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.33. was Adminiſtred by ſprinkling or pouring on, not by dipping; and the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Children, and coldneſs of our climate is a juſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for this manner of Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:172229:32"/> ſo that either of theſe may be uſed without contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Water what way ſoever, muſt be <hi>Solemnly and religiouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed</hi> in the holy form, and with the holy Rites which God hath appointed; for every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon waſhing or application is not <hi>Baptiſme:</hi> but <hi>water con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated</hi> by the word of inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and prayer; and as an <hi>act of worſhip to</hi> God, <hi>and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of faith applied in the name</hi> (that is by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to the dedication of the perſon Baptized to faith in, and holy profeſſion) of <hi>Father Son and Holy Ghoſt;</hi> is the Sacrament of Baptiſm; ſo that as the Apoſtle doth well check the horrid prophaneneſs of ſuch as deemed the common eating of bread, and drinking of wine
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:172229:32"/> to be the Lords Supper, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring <hi>The Cup of bleſſing which we bleſſe</hi> is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the blood of Chriſt, and <hi>the Bread which we break</hi> is the Communion of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. thereby pointing unto the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne and Religious Rites which muſt diſtinguiſh the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per from common eating and drinking; ſo the Solemne and Religious Application of water diſtinguiſheth the Sacrament of Baptiſme from all other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon waſhing.</p>
            <p>Concluſ. 3. <hi>Baptiſme muſt be adminiſtred by a lawfull Miniſter;</hi> this water may not be applied by every or any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate hand; the Lord Jeſus hath joyned it in Commiſſion <hi>with teaching and diſcipling,</hi> ſo that ſuch only that have the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:172229:33"/> of the one have the Authority of the other; Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is on all hands agreed on to be an <hi>act of office</hi> and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and not to be given by men out of office; it is <hi>a Seale</hi> which muſt be <hi>ſtamped</hi> (not by a childiſh impreſſion: but) <hi>with Power and Authority,</hi> to make it valid, <hi>a ground of faith,</hi> pleadable in prayer; ſo that the Baptiſme of women and private Perſons (on what pretended neceſſity ſoever it be) is wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and prophane; nay in my judgement is void and null, and not to be ſalved with a <hi>quod fieri non debuit factum valet, that unlawfull things are valid when paſt and done;</hi> though I cannot with the Donatiſts grant that the efficacy of the Ordinance depends on the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Adminiſtrator, yet
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:172229:33"/> I cannot but believe that the <hi>Authority of the inſtitutor</hi> is eſſentiall to every Goſpell Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance to the Church, and muſt be found in every Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrator; Ordained Miniſters muſt give us Sacraments, I and preach the Word too if we will not be cheated of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and content our ſelves with mock Ordinances; my muddy brains could never yet conceive the God of Order to make Office and Authority eſſentiall to politicall tranſactions in Kingdomes and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, and yet to leave his Church in ſuch confuſion, that the great Affaires of Salvation ſhall be diſpenced by every common hand; as if his care were more for the world then the Church, which if it be, I will never go to the Houſe of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:172229:34"/> God to behold the beauty of his Holineſs, which ſhines more brightly in the wide Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>Concluſ. 4. <hi>Baptiſme muſt be adminiſtred unto fit ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects:</hi> all Subjects ſute not the Ordinance; Creatures inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and irrationall are incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Grace of God, and theſe holy Adminiſtrations thereof; the baptizing of Bels, Churches, Fonts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is a piece of Conſecration, neither pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed nor allowed in the New Teſtament; but to be damned as prophane and ſuperſtitious; they muſt be the ſubjects of Life and Reaſon that will lie in the leaſt Capacity of Grace and Holineſs; and ſuch are the Sons of men.</p>
            <p>Sons of men are Subjects capable of Grace and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:172229:34"/> but the ſpeciall diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations thereof in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, and its Seales, calls for ſpeciall qualifications; and therefore Baptiſme may not be given to men as men, and meerely the ſons of <hi>Adam,</hi> no, they muſt firſt be the <hi>ſeed of Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17.13. <hi>for the Covenant of God muſt be in their fleſh,</hi> and by Preaching they muſt be <hi>diſcipled</hi> into the Chriſtian Church, and ſee that the <hi>Promiſe is to them and to their Children</hi> before they be Baptized <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38, 39. for Baptiſme muſt be <hi>the Seale of the Righteouſneſs of faith, which we have being not yet Baptized,</hi> Rom. 4.11. ſo that the fit Subjects for Baptiſme muſt be not only men, but <hi>Faederati,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Covenant with God,</hi> to whom the Promiſe may be
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:172229:35"/> judged to belong: they muſt be made Chriſtians, and lay hold on the Covenant of God, and then be Baptiſed; I could drive out of your common diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe an ordinary terme rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to Baptiſme <hi>(viz ſuch a one is Chriſtned)</hi> if I did not hope you well underſtand it: Baptiſme may <hi>Chriſtianum di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, declare and pronounce a man a Chriſtian:</hi> but it doth not <hi>Chriſtianum facere, make a Chriſtian;</hi> if your Children be not made Chriſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ans by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Covenant to believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and their ſeed, bring them not to me to be Baptized; moſt curſedly prophane was the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Papiſts in <hi>America,</hi> who with whips and ſcourges drave the unchriſtani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed untaught <hi>Indians</hi> to the Fonts to be Baptized; for that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:172229:35"/> Baptiſme belongs to none but Chriſts diſciples, and Covenant People.</p>
            <p>Baptiſme belongs to <hi>all Chriſts Diſciples and Gods Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant People,</hi> ſo that none of them may without ſin, nay ſacriledg be barred from Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme; and theſe are reſolved into two ranks, and known by two names in the Church <hi>(viz) Infidells converted to the faith, and the Infants of one or both Chriſtian Parents:</hi> Theſe two are the orders into which Gods faederates have been Ranked, ever ſince Gods Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant was eſtabliſhed, and his Church was eſtated in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and their ſeed: as to the firſt of them, they are on all hands conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to as fit and proper Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, onely our over-pious age
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:172229:36"/> hath ſtarted the quaery, How and when they muſt be judged converted to the faith? which I muſt needs reſolve to be by <hi>a profeſſion of ſaving faith,</hi> not <hi>the ſaving Profeſſion of faith,</hi> and poſſeſſion of ſincere Grace which the Congregating Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts call for; ſincere grace and ſaving Profeſſion muſt be the ſoules care, and ground of joy: but cannot be the ſigne that ſhall guide the Church in giving the Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme; <hi>aſſoon as they profeſſed to believe, Philip Preaching the things of God, and the name of Jeſus Chriſt, they were Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed both men and women,</hi> Act. 8.12. <hi>Philip</hi> required no more of the <hi>Eunuch</hi> in <hi>v.</hi> 37. and when I hear <hi>Peter</hi> declared <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> the Sorcerer to be after his Baptiſme in the Gall of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:172229:36"/> and bond of iniquity, as <hi>v.</hi> 23. I perceive they in whoſe company he was Baptized yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no more; and when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member <hi>Annànias</hi> and <hi>Saphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, Demas,</hi> and other Baptized Perſons proved hypocrites and reprobates; I cannot believe they poſſeſſed <hi>ſincere Grace,</hi> or made <hi>a ſaving Profeſſion,</hi> though they profeſſed <hi>ſaving Faith;</hi> I cannot yet turn <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian</hi> and believe true Grace, may be finally and totally loſt, and a man may be a child of God to day, and a child of the Devill to morrow; I have not faith enough to believe that when God made me <hi>a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> he made me <hi>a God,</hi> and endowed me with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of to ſearching the heart: nor have I wit enough to conceive that God making me a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:172229:37"/> Steward of his Miſteries, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes to my as my guide the qualification of ſubjects, which lies beyond my knowledg. I believe the groſſe enormities of many baptized Saints (as they call themſelves) hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced them, that true Grace is not within their ſight, but they may and have baptized hypocrites: why then do they call for that qualification God hath not directed and they can not diſcern? God hath made the tongue the trumpet of the heart, and I can better hope men will not play the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite and make that utter an uncertain ſound, then I can know the ſincerity of their Grace.</p>
            <p>Though Infidels converted to the Faith be generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved within the Covenant,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:172229:37"/> yet ſince the dayes of <hi>Baltha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar Pacimontanus,</hi> (who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to have derived his fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from <hi>Luther,</hi> conſtrained <hi>Luther</hi> to write againſt him in the year of our <hi>Lord,</hi> 1527.) The Right of Infants to the Covenant of God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently their capacity for Baptiſme hath been called in queſtion, and of late yeares hath met with moſt high and violent (though irrational and unſcripturall oppoſition) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I cannot but admire at the erroneous induſtry of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipaedobaptiſts,</hi> to curtail Gods Covenant, cut off their ſeed from the priviledges of Grace, and caſt away their own rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, blinding their eyes againſt plaine demonſtrations of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the Antient enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Church; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:172229:38"/> we muſt ſee better warrant before we ſtrike hands with them, and be of their unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table beliefe; for if I know any thing of the method of Gods Covenant, or in the leaſt how to Reaſon from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, It is as cleare as the Sun that the Infants of believing Parents, Gods Covenant Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whilſt Infants, and as their naturall ſeed are Gods faede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, and within his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and ſo fit Subjects of Baptiſme.</p>
            <p>In politicall and all civill tranſactions of men, we find all the world over that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants made from or to parents, do uſually include children as their children, ſo that by that very relation, without any new formall contract, they claime Priviledges, and ſtand bound
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:172229:38"/> to duty; and when I conſider Gods way of dealing to be according to mans capacity and humane method, I have no ground on which to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that he hath inverted the order, and cut off Relation in the conveighing of the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Grace, and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a peculiar People to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; for Gods ſpeciall diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations do ordinarily run in the ſame Channell, though not with the ſame Latitude that his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Providences do: and then when God after the manner of men aſſumes to himſelfe a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, without doubt he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers Honours on and looks for Loyalty from his ſubjects, and their ſeed or off-ſpring, who as their ſeed are born heires of ſuch Honour and duty.</p>

Theſe things, I ſay, conſidered, I muſt pluck up my reaſon by the very root if I do not by unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyable conſequence conſtraine my conſcience to believe and preach this point of Doctrine, (viz) <hi>In New-Teſtament times under the Goſpel-adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Covenant of Grace, the natural iſſue, or infants of believing parents are in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God, and under the promiſes of ſalvation.</hi> And when I look upon <hi>Peters</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to the converting Jews to believe and be baptized, <hi>for the promiſe is to you and to your children, even to all that are a far off, as many as the Lord our God ſhall call,</hi> Act 2.38, 39.</p>

               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:172229:47"/> And my mind is very foggie, I am much out if this terme of Relation do not dictate a Priviledge and Propriety by virtue of relation which chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of ſuch parents as children ſhould enjoy, above what chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of other parents did or could enjoy) is too ſhort a Feſcue to make me read other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
            <p>Thus then it doth fully and plainly appear, that under Old and New Teſtament admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of the Covenant of Grace, the infants of believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parents are <hi>Foederati</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Covenant, and ſo fit and proper ſubjects of baptiſm to be baptized. Nor is their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacity of making a vocal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith any bar to their baptiſm, for profeſſion ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply creates no right to baptiſm,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:172229:47"/> I never read the divil was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and I believe the Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Saints will not now bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize him; Yet he really believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and more then once pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, That Jeſus Chriſt was the Son of God. Profeſſion as an evidence of Covenant-intereſt, was the Churches guide to baptiſm, and the Scripture giving another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of Covenant-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, <hi>viz</hi> Deſcent from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving parents; that is alſo regarded, and the one to be no bar to the other, but both in their place gives due directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on who are foederates, and to be baptized.</p>
            <p>Nor is the Argument of any more force becauſe the Scripture mentioneth vocal profeſſion and baptiſm upon it, but paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the other in ſilence; for
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:172229:48"/> occaſional and circumſtantial actions are no binding prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, or univerſal direction to the Church of God. The Church is founded in grown perſons, whoſe Covenant-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt can be known no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe but by vocal profeſſion, but it may be edified by infant Branches, who by a courſe of nature partake of the fatneſſe of the Olive, having the birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right of the Covenant. Thus it was with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his iſſue, and ſo with us. 2.

            <p>Laſt of all, Infants inability to action is no bar to their bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, becauſe it voids not their intereſt in the Covenant: and the Sacrament is ſuch wherein they are to be meerly Paſſive. When I obſerve God to have appointed the initiating Seal of initiating grace to be ſuch where men of the greateſt
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:172229:49"/> activity are altogether Paſſive; he ſeemes to me to ſuggeſt theſe ſhall not act in their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into the Church, and receiving of my Covenant; that inability to action may be no bar or hindrance to ſuch as have no leſſe intereſt in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; and only Covenant-intereſt ſhall make capable of the Seal.</p>
            <p>Let not any Antipaedobaptiſt think to amaze us by crying, Why, Sir, on this ground in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants may have a right to the Lords Supper, for we ſay ſo too; they have <hi>jus ad rem,</hi> though not <hi>jus in re,</hi> their right is not denyed, though pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent incapacity hinders their injoyment.</p>
            <p>Theſe things conſidered, we muſt tell the Anabaptiſt, That
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:172229:49"/> infants right to the Covenant, and enjoyment of the initiating Seale, having been continued throughout the old world un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law without the leaſt controule, and alſo under the Goſpell for more then 1600 yeares, without any Generall interruption or the leaſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance, untill within this 200 yeares; we muſt find bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter warrant to diveſt us of it, before we part with it; and our antiquity (on ſo clear a title) in the enjoyment, me thinks ſhould be no meane ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to ingenuity; for we ſay in this caſe as <hi>Jephthah</hi> to the King of <hi>Ammon,</hi> Judges 11.26. <hi>When Iſrael dwelt in Heſhbon and her towns, in Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er &amp; her towns, and in all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Arnon, three hundred years why did ye not then recover
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:172229:50"/> them in that ſpace?</hi> ſo whilſt infant right to the Covenant, and initiating Seale dwelt in <hi>Judea</hi> and her towns, in <hi>Aſia</hi> and her towns, and in all the Cities of the Church of God, and the borders thereof 2000 yeares, why did you not reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them in that ſpace? ſurely now you may deſpair of ever doing it; how much ſoever you diſturb our peace, we will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver part with this priviledge.</p>
            <p>Concluſ. 5. <hi>The ſignifying of the blood of Chriſt with its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and the ſealing of the Covenant of Grace is the end of Baptiſme;</hi> Baptiſme is both a ſigne and Seale to excite our thoughts, and affect our mind with the blood of Jeſus, &amp; aſſure our hearts of a right unto the Priviledges of the Covenant, ſo as to argue them to our ſoule as
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:172229:50"/> grounds of faith on which we are to urge God in Prayer: herein it agreeth with other Sacraments, and in ſpeciall cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, into whoſe place and end it hath ſucceeded, in that it is <hi>a ſign and Seale of the righteouſneſs of faith,</hi> Rom. 4.11. And ſo the analogy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween water in all its proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the blood of Chriſt doth clearly hold, and the Scripture doth plainly attribute Remiſſion, Sanctification Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation and Salvation to the outward ſigne or act of Baptiſme, as the Graces to be brought to our minds, and made ſure to our Soules there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.26. <hi>Titus</hi> 3.3. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21.

And <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> aggravates the Apoſtaſie of Chriſtians, nay non-proficiency in Grace with this, <hi>They have forgot they were waſhed from their old ſins,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9. Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme will be a monument of perfidy againſt profane Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to all Eternity, and aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate their miſery: ſo that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Baptiſme doe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh

            <p>Here note that I have not wit enough to conceive that the end of the Sacrament makes againſt infant Baptiſme, for infants are capable of Right though not of claime and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, and Baptiſme is given as a ground, not effect of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian claime; I ſee noe reaſon why infants may not be Sealed in the cradle as well as Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the mothers belly; nor is there any force in the confae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the Baptized un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it muſt needs be actively and cannot be paſſively done; I conceive parentall power in dedication to God, and the Soveraign nature of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant impoſing on the party Sealed, the condition to be by him performed as well as ſealing the comforts to be enjoyed, doth
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:172229:52"/> fully enforce the confaederation of ſuch as are at the preſent non-agents; It will be a hard matter to make me believe that Gods condeſcenſion hath loſt his authority any more in the Covenant of Grace then in the Covennat of Works; or that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are not as capable of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faederation by Baptiſme, as they were by Circumciſion.</p>
            <p>I have done with the firſt thing to ſhew you what Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>me is, and now come to the ſecond to ſhew what is here meant by confident approach:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Approach to God is the act of a Baptized ſoule,</hi> and it is done either by <hi>the perception of faith</hi> which is the evidence of things not ſeen, and ſubſtance of things hoped for: <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. This is that perſonall and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate act of the ſoule whereby
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:172229:53"/> it ſeeth and ſaluteth God at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with ſighs and groans which cannot be uttered, and receives an aſſent unto truth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, which is or cannot be expreſſed, and hereby we deny not the Baptiſed, in extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary cauſes where the body cannot be waſhed by pure wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; as in an <hi>Indian</hi> Countrey remote from the Church, or in the Church under a limitted order and ſeaſon of Baptiſing, as it was in ſome Churches in primitive times, when they Baptized but twice in a year, may draw nigh to God; no doubt but the Catechumeni, ſuch as learned their Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſme in order unto Baptiſme, had ſweet communion with God alone whilſt they wanted Communion with the Church, otherwiſe they had never
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:172229:53"/> been able to endure Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>Or <hi>by the poſſeſſion of Glory,</hi> when the Soule departing out of the body returnes to God who gave it, and is received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, or eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall bliſſe in the preſence of God for ever; and this I deny not may be, and doubt not is enjoyed by many unbaptiſed; I can neither with ſome <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts</hi> grant that all that dye in infancy, and before ſtained with actuall guilt are certainly ſaved; I ſee no warrant for it: nor yet with the Papiſts do I think all that die unbaptized are damned; I believe Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is neceſſary by reaſon of Gods command, and as the ordinary Ark or meanes of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and ſo the ſinfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt or neglect of it to be
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:172229:54"/> damnable (though I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine God will charge it on the helpeleſſe infant) yet I ſee not its neceſſity to be ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute that providence ſuperce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Ordinance by unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable death ſets the ſoule under inevitable condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I have confidence to meet many an uncircumciſed <hi>Iſrael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite</hi> in Heaven, who died before the eighth day of his age; and if in any, in this caſe God will have mercy and not Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
            <p>Or by <hi>the preſentation of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> and performance of publick devoire in the Tabernacle of the Lord, going up with his Scribes, worſhiping in his San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, and in the Aſſemblies of his People in all the parts of Gods Worſhip; this is an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing before God in <hi>Zion,</hi>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:172229:54"/> and a drawing nigh unto him in his Holy place, not to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the uncircumciſed among the Jews, nor unbaptized among Chriſtians; this unto me ſeems to be the <hi>drawing nigh</hi> intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Text, and is that I intend in the Doctrine <hi>(viz)</hi> That the Leviticall Rites be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aboliſhed, and the way of acceſs to God is now by Goſpell Ordinances: they that will uſe them muſt begin at Baptiſme, and firſt have their bodies waſhed with pure Water, and be thereby made members of the body or Church of Chriſt, and be conſecrated unto God; without which ſuch as have the charge of Gods Holy things muſt keep them from intermedling with them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Confidence</hi> is the adjunct quality of this act of approach

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:172229:56"/> priviledge to them is given full aſſurance of ready acceptance, for the way is open to, the Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, the Vale is rent, the High Prieſt gone before, and the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty left Common to all ſuch (though none but ſuch) as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their hearts ſprinkled from an evill conſcience, and their bodies waſhed with pure water do draw nigh to the ſame; both theſe are neceſſary qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: for, an approach to God without an heart ſprinkled muſt needs be diffident, and full of doubts, and without a body waſhed, dreadfull and full of horrour.</p>
            <p>The Text and doctrine you have had explained, and you ſee the point of doctrine plainely aſſerting, That Baptiſme or the body waſhed with pure water is the eſpecial qualification that

            <p>The next thing to be done is to prove the doctrine, and it is in it ſelfe a truth ſo plaine that none that underſtand any thing of the method of Goſpell worſhip, and the neceſſitie of outward acts and bodie quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications in approaches to an holy God, but do ſubſcribe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the truth of it; indeed the late ſpiritual Chymiſts who have by our late overlarge liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of conſcience, (I mean ſinful toleration,) had the boldneſs to blaſpheme all Gods holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and under a pretence of ſpirituality, to nullifie all outward acts of worſhip <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Reaſ. 1. <hi>Baptiſme prepared the way of the Meſſiah, or Chriſt his appearance in and approach to the Church:</hi> the qualification that fits the Church for Chriſt
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:172229:57"/> his approah to her, fits the Church for approach to Chriſt or God; for theſe are recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, the one goes not without a return of the other, and the ſame qualification muſt be in both; for that holy Majeſty is preſent, Holineſſe is in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of the Saints, when God comes to his people as well as in Heaven where his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple come to him: and all that will walk in this conſuming fire and meet this Meſſiah, and be made fit to enjoy him, muſt not onely have the heart ſprinkled but alſo the body waſhed with pure water; <hi>Baptiſme</hi> is the Sanctification of the People, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to prepare them for Gods appearence in Mount Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the voice of the Grand Herald crying in the wilderneſs <hi>prepare ye the way of the Lord,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:172229:58"/> make his paths ſtrait,</hi> Mat. 3. <hi>Repent and be Baptiſed:</hi> The Mace of Majeſty borne by the Meſſenger of the Meſſiah to ſtrike awe in, and require ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection from the expectants of his coming, was, <hi>the Baptiſme of amendment of life:</hi> The le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling Engine that pulled down and made plain all mountainy and proud hearts that withſtood the coming of Chriſt in his firſt appearance, was <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> inſomuch that the Scribes and Phariſees who rejected the counſell of God againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves not <hi>being Baptized,</hi> are all along branded as enemies, who would not have Chriſt reign over them: in a word, the promiſed and propheſied <hi>Elias,</hi> who was to come before the Lord to prepare his way, is from his preparative work
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:172229:58"/> (which is plainly declared to have been Preaching and Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing) denominated <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> and the way of the Lord thus prepared is proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a ground of Confidence to the Church; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.3.9.11. So that if the way of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah his appearance muſt be the way of the Churches approach to him: as it is evident it muſt in that Baptiſme, did not onely precede, but alſo followes his appearance, for <hi>John</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt did not onely prepare for his coming, but ever ſince his aſcenſion his Miniſters do go teach and Baptize into the name of Father, Sonne and Holy Ghoſt; Baptiſme hath ever been the Diſcipling forme, method of matriculation in his Schoole, and incorporation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his body, and ſolemne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:172229:59"/> unto communion with him of all ſuch as were afarre off, but are now made nigh, even the people of the living God; their Baptiſme is the qualification that fits for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident approach to God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which we cannot be aſſured of acceptance.</p>
            <p>Reaſ. 2. <hi>Baptiſme prepared Jeſus Chriſt unto the work of Mediatorſhip:</hi> The way of acceſs to God is the ſame for the people as Prieſt; for the Head as Members; for the Church as for Chriſt: the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour as Man muſt manifeſt himſelfe Holy in all things; not onely in an immunity from all poſitive acts of ſin, but alſo a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive performance of all duty, he becomes in all things obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent unto the Father; lives in Communion with the Church,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:172229:59"/> and is conforme to all holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; proclaiming himſelfe a Member of the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he propoſe himſelfe a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator for or to the Church; <hi>he is Baptized</hi> becauſe it thus became him to fulfill all Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, by his ſubjection to Ordinances, and thereby ſuiting himſelfe for his worke: he doth not only ſhew but ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie them to be the way of acceſs to the Father; for he as our High Prieſt hath left open the ſame way of approach, and as the Captain hath marched in the ſame ſteps of ſalvation in which we are to follow him, and we ſhall find <hi>him Baptized,</hi> and ſo immediately entring on the exerciſe of his Mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: when (and not till then) he was Baptized, he is <hi>ſolemnly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>augurated into his office,</hi> coming
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:172229:60"/> out of the water the Spirit came viſibly on him, and the voice was heard, <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed, hear him.</hi> We never read of his praying preaching and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate with the Divel till he was Baptized, and no <hi>ſooner was he Baptized,</hi> but, as conſecrated to God, he <hi>Prayed, Luk.</hi> 3.21. as confirmed to the Combate, <hi>he was led immediately into the wilderneſſe to be tempted. Mar.</hi> 1 12. And as one now completely fitted to tranſact the buſineſs of mans ſalvation, <hi>he preached the Kingdom of God,</hi> Mat. 4. By all which the Mediator doth plainly dictate, That acts of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe muſt move in order, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at Baptiſm: and that Baptiſm doth fit men to prayer, for temptation and all publick acts of Religion; and if any
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:172229:60"/> will in confidence of acceptance follow the Mediator, they muſt have their body firſt waſhed with pure water, and be by Baptiſme thereunto prepared.</p>
            <p>Reaſ. 3. <hi>Circumciſion was the qualification of confident aproach to God under the old Covenant:</hi> And therefore Baptiſm having ſucceeded into the place, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ſtead, &amp; ſerving to the end for which Circumciſion ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, muſt be ſo under the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. The adminiſtration of the Covenant may be altered, but the Covenant it ſelf abides ſubſtancially, the ſame to the Church of God both in the Old and New Teſtament. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are permanent and inſeparable adjuncts to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant as grounds of Faith: and however the different admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration may cauſe a change
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:172229:61"/> in the Rite and outward Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, in the matter applyed, or form of application, yet is there no change in their uſe and ſignification: but what was of old ſignified by the Seals of the Covenant, the ſame is now ſignified by ſuch as have ſucceeded into their place; thus the Lords Supper ſupplyeth the room of the Paſſeover, and Baptiſm the room of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion; ſo that whatever Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion did confer on its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the ſame priviledges are by Baptiſm conferred on its ſubjects. And Circumciſion was to the Jews the <hi>door of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi> into the Church, the <hi>Ceremony of Conſecration</hi> to ſuch as approach to the Lord: and the <hi>Character of diſtinction</hi> on the people of the living God, and ſo the qualification that was
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:172229:61"/> unto them the ground of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in approach to God; hence <hi>Circumciſion and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion</hi> are the diſtinguiſhing terms between the Jewes (the only people related unto God) and the Gentiles (that were afar off, without God, and without hope in the world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.26. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.11, 12.) and the approach of the uncircumciſed unto the Sanctuary of God, is declared to be a polluting and profaning of Gods Sanctuary, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44 7, 9. therefore ſuch are forbidden the leaſt approach to God; they may not enter the Sanctuary nor obſerve the Lords Paſſeover, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.48. Nay, the uncircumciſed muſt be cut off from the Lord people, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.14. And if a ſtranger will come nigh to God and have a place in his Sanctuary,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:172229:62"/> he muſt firſt lay hold on the Covenant of God and be Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed; ſo that by Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion Jews were acknowledged and Gentiles proſelyted mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, entituled to the Covenant, and entruſted with the liberty of acceſſe to God in his Sanctuary.</p>
            <p>That Baptiſm is the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance under the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment anſwering unto Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion in the Old, can any that obſerve the <hi>order of Goſpel,</hi> the <hi>ceſſation of Circumciſion,</hi> the <hi>regular ſucceſſion of Baptiſm</hi> into its place, believe ſome <hi>ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Seal eſſential to Goſpel ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration,</hi> and ſee none eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed if Baptiſme be excluded? and find <hi>Baptiſm</hi> in all things fully <hi>ſignificant of what was ſignified by Circumciſion,</hi> deny that Baptiſm is ſucceeded into
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:172229:62"/> the room, ſerves to the end that Circumciſion did; and ſo confers the ſame priviledge of confidence, and is Eſſentially neceſſary to ſuch as approach to God in acts of worſhip. Unto ſuch I would in ſhort ſay, D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And is not this agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſufficient to demonſtrate, that Baptiſm is now what Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was of old to the Church? What if in ſome things theſe two Seals do differ, is the difference ſo eſſential as to deny the ſucceſſion of the one to the other? It is true, the one was by blood, the other by water; the one is to male and femal, both ſexes, the other to males only; the one limitted to the eighth day, the other left at liberty: but do theſe or the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:172229:63"/> like hinder either the one or other from being ordinances of Incorporation to the Church, Conſecration to God, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation to our confidence in drawing nigh to God? Will not the differences be found as many and great between the Paſſeover and the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, yet the ſucceſſion of the one to the other will not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed?

We never read that by the virtue of it they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, or the Jews divided to them any portion of the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> And it will be an hard matter to make me believe it did to them Seal a Blank, for that I find it in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture called, <hi>A laying hold on the Covenant of God;</hi> and the Uncircumciſion are declared ſtrangers to the Covenant, and without God, and without hope in the world. Why doth the Apoſtle define Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to be the Seal of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of Faith? I find
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:172229:65"/> this phraſe to denominate the Covenant of Grace and its Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual priviledges; but that it ever denominated <hi>Canaan,</hi> or any National priviledges, I am yet to be informed. And the limitation of it unto the perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal faith of <hi>Abraham</hi> is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent to the ſcope of the Text, abſurde in it ſelf, and ſmells ſo much of Popiſh <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi> that I cannot but avoid (I had almoſt ſaid ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor) it. But laſtly, I would Quaery whether the adverſaries of Circumciſion ſealing the Covenant of Grace, did ever yet obſerve <hi>adjuncts ſeparable from a Covenant to bear the name of a Covenant?</hi> or did ever yet diſcern that the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was an <hi>appendant</hi> on the Covenant, but not of the <hi>eſſence</hi> of the Covenant, which
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:172229:65"/> if they well ſtudy, I doubt not but they will correct their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and the errors thence ariſing, and ſo with us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That Circumciſion ſealed Spiritual priviledges to the Jews as Baptiſm doth to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; and Baptiſm ſucceeding to its uſe and ends, muſt have the ſame ſubjects, and is now the ſpecial ground of confident approach to God.</p>
            <p>Reaſ. 4. <hi>The nature and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Baptiſm doth diſpoſe unto a confident approach to God:</hi> Baptiſm is a Seal and the firſt Seal to the Covenant of Grace and Salvation, and ſo is a ground of Faith, and an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement in acceſſe to God. But in the <hi>Nature of Baptiſm</hi> three things do diſpoſe unto confidence in approach to the Lord:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:172229:66"/>1. It is an Ordinance of Conjunction to the Church.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſecration to God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Confoederation with God. And every one of theſe are Reaſons of boldneſſe in Acceſs and aſſurance of Acceptance.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Baptiſm is an Ordinance of coojuuction to the Church. The Church is Chriſts Body, and every individual Chriſtian is the members thereof, unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Baptiſm as by Nerves and Sinews: None but the Church may come nigh unto God, in <hi>Zion</hi> every one muſt appear before God: Chriſt is only converſant with his Spouſe, if the Gentiles will draw nigh to the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> they muſt joyn themſelves to Iſrael the people of the Lord: and all believers that will come nigh to God, muſt be added to the <hi>Church;</hi> all the promiſes of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:172229:66"/> God are made to the <hi>Church;</hi> and all the adminiſtrations of the Covenant are in and to the <hi>Church; Ex Eccleſia nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la Salus,</hi> out of the Church no Salvation. They that will come nigh to God as his children, muſt be the daughters of <hi>Sion,</hi> of the houſhold of Faith, and Commonwealth of Iſrael. To be caſt out of the Church, is to be debarred all priviledges of grace, &amp; delivered over to Satan: for that relation to the Church is the only reaſon of every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual believers claim of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and priviledges, &amp; ground of confidence in all worſhip un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God; and this relation is conferred by Baptiſm, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. <hi>We are all Baptized in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one Body, whether we be Jews or Greeks, bond or free.</hi> Baptiſm is the only badg of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction to the Lords people;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:172229:67"/> the very door of admiſſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the houſhold of Faith; the very method of matriculation to Chriſt, his Diſciples; and manner of adding to the Church ſuch as ſhall be ſaved, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41. In a word, Baptiſm is the band of union to all Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, binding them to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant adherencie to his Name, and joynt attendance on his Worſhip, and is the bar of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion from all others that are yet ſtrangers to the Covenant; ſo as that until baptized they may not communicate of the holy things of God with the Church, nor come nigh with them to the Lord. In the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times of the Church the Catechumeniſts, who were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for Baptiſm, not having been yet Baptized, were ſent from Church Communion and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:172229:67"/> holy priviledges with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane and paenitentiaries by the cry of <hi>Sacra Sacris, holy things for holy men:</hi> but when by Baptiſme they were incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the Church then they continued in <hi>prayer, breaking of bread and every act of Worſhip to God with confidence:</hi> ſo that till the Church appear <hi>our mother</hi> we ſee no warrant to <hi>call God Father,</hi> his children are no vagrants in the high way and hedges, and when begotten by uncorruptible ſeed of the Word were by Baptiſme, placed in the lap, and laid to the breſts of the Church, then as her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren we claim all the Priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the Covenant and come to the throne of Grace with confidence; nor may any with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a forfeiture of Baptiſme be judicially exacted by the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:172229:68"/> Church deny our relation and liberty of acceſſe to God; I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet could conceive any warrantable reaſon to deny the liberty of acceſſe to the Lords table to ſuch Baptized ſoules whoſe horrid profaneneſs and obſtinate ſpirits did not make them obnoxious to the cenſures of the Church in order to their excommunications and diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring from the body, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Circumciſion did not more firmly incorporate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church under the Law, and conferre a liberty of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto the Sanctuary, then Baptiſme doth under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Baptiſme <hi>is an Ordinance of Conſecration unto God,</hi> God is a God of Holineſs and will be ſanctified in ſuch as come unto him; none may appear
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:172229:68"/> before him in their prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; the Maſſe of Mankind is ſo prophaned with ſin that men in common may not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before God, ſuch as ſhall adore him muſt be adorned for him, and if they will hold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him they muſt be conſecrated to him; God never comes nigh to Iſrael but he firſt calls to have <hi>the people Sanctified,</hi> nor comes the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> before his Meſſenger had <hi>prepared his way;</hi> Iſrael the onely Nation that holds communion with and comes to God are called <hi>an holy Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> becauſe con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:172229:69"/> wedding Super, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. And the only Ordinance of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration to God is Baptiſme: This is the badg of diſtinction and bar of diviſion between the holy and prophane; if the Lord Jeſus will preſent his Church to God he <hi>Sanctifieth it by the waſhing of water through the Word.</hi> Epheſ. 5.26. And if ever we will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven we muſt be born <hi>of the water and ſpirit:</hi> by Baptiſme we are <hi>purified from the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are in the world through luſt,</hi> and ſolemnly dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated unto the name of Father Son and Holy Ghoſt, hereby we are ſeparated from the world and added to the Church; and the Baptized continue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the Apoſtles doctrine <hi>in prayer and breaking of bread, and all acts of worſhip,</hi> ſo that

            <p n="3">3. Baptiſme <hi>is an Ordinance of Confaederation with God;</hi> two cannot walke together ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they be agreed; God is a conſuming fire to man if he condeſcend not a Covenant, as a ſhreene to prevent its ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heat; <hi>I will be your God and ye ſhall be my people</hi> is the onely argument of encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to <hi>Abraham</hi> to walk with God and aſſurance of Believers acceptance with God; guilty man cannot come nigh offended God without ſome aſſurance that wrath is appeaſed and God Reconciled: none ſince <hi>Adams</hi>

            <p>We ſee then, that if we will be guided in our drawing nigh, God by the way of Chriſt, his appearance to his Church,

            <p>They are ſuch who,</p>

            <p n="4">4. Diſeſteeme the priviledges conferred by Baptiſm.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Declare not to theirs Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized the dignity and duty of Baptiſm.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Deny the Baptized the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of acceſſe to God in the aſſemblies of his people and uſe of his Ordinances.</p>
            <p>Unto each of theſe this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine doth ſpeak Reproof and Blame, as we ſhall note in the particular conſideration of them. And</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> If the waſhing of the body with pure water or Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:172229:80"/> be the eſpecial qualification of confident approach to God in the aſſemblies of his people, then Generally are they too blame, who do <hi>Dictate to the unbaptized a liberty of acceſſe to God.</hi> Many in this Remiſſe age of ours, can make Baptiſm a matter of no moment in their Communion; they can hold Communion with baptized or unbaptiſed, and cry out, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion or uncircumciſion is to them nothing, as if this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Baptiſm were ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred indifferent as the nullified Ordinance of Circumciſion. And they themſelves complain of rigor and ſeverity in ſuch as impoſe Baptiſm as the ground of Communion in the Church, and decline the adminiſtration of holy things to the unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; theſe call for inward

For if it be the qualification of acceſſe to God, the door of admiſſion into the aſſemblies of Gods people, and way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration unto Communion in the holy things of God: muſt it not needs be profaneneſſe to adminiſter the holy things of God to ſuch as are not thus qualified? and preſumption to invite ſuch unto the participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:172229:82"/> of them? But a little to expoſtulate with the aſſerters of this Baptiſm-ſubverting notion: Will God be worſhipped by outward Ordinaces? and muſt theſe Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be enjoyed in order, ſome preparing for participation to others? Is Baptiſm the firſt Ordinance of the Goſpel? Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiating Seal of the Covenant? Door of admiſſion into the Church? and method of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triculation into the houſhold of Faith? and way of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration unto Communion with God and his people? Is it not reckoned among the firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Word of God, to be learned by all Diſciples en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into Chriſt's School? And if ſo, muſt it not be horrid profaneneſs to decry the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Baptiſm and its Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine?
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:172229:82"/> To expoſe communion with God and his people to common hands never ſanctified, and by body waſhing ſeparated from the heap of mankind, on whom Baptiſm never ſtamped holineſſe? and groſſe impiety to fling open the door of Gods houſe that dogs and ſwine may enter at pleaſure, there being no baptiſmal badge of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction between them and the children of God? Is it not great prodigality to offer the priviledges of the Covenant to every hand, not having any Sealed intereſt whereon to claim? Is it not grievous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption to decline the directed order of the Goſpel, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence the holy things of God in a way and method contrary to that whereby Chriſt and his Apoſtles either injoyned or
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:172229:83"/> adminiſtred them? Muſt not this needs be Superſtition, Will-worſhip, a laying waſte Divine directions, and running from the Rule of Scripture, and due method of holy things?

            <p>The ſixth and laſt ſort, whoſe principles and practiſe doe plainly millitate againſt the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Baptiſme, and cleerly doe contradict the ſame, are ſuch, <hi>who
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:172229:113"/> deny the baptized the libertie of acceſs to God in the aſſemblies of his people.</hi> This I well know to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late unto the moſt eminent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Goſpel order and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders unto pietie, that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us; and therefore the moſt tender rebuke will ſeem to be <hi>railing violence and bitterneſs:</hi> But be it what it will, ſin againſt Gods Ordinances muſt not paſs without a zealous and ſerious reproof. Such among us as affect the term of <hi>Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Brethren,</hi> in the gathering of their Churches, run into an extreme as farre wide on the one hand, as the looſe levelling Familiſts and Anabaptiſts are on the other: Theſe dictate a liberty of acceſs <hi>to the unbapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,</hi> and thoſe denie it <hi>to the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</hi> We muſt needs imagine they agree both in one principle,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:172229:114"/> that <hi>Baptiſme is not the ground of communion with the Church vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,</hi> nor qualification of acceſs to God; For if it be otherwiſe, as we have noted, it muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs to admit without it; and they have need of good war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that will acquit themſelves from impietie, in excluding the baptized from theſe priviledges. That ſuch are among us, who debarre the baptized from their priviledges, is ſo obvious to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obſervant eye of the now on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cryed up <hi>Church way,</hi> that I need not much urge demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof.

But if in the termes charged any ſhall deny this to be acted among us, I ſhall deſire to underſtand why they declare privatly and publiquely <hi>men baptized,</hi> to be ſtrangers to God and his Covenant? why doe they decline communion with, and a care of baptized ſoules, as members of the Church? and dictate a neceſſitie of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Church-way and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip? and why doe they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect other wayes for admiſſion of Church members? is there any terms more ordinarie in the mouthes of the <hi>congregated ſaints</hi> towards thoſe whom they live amongſt, than <hi>doggs, without, unbeleevers,</hi> not in a Church way?

If by the waſhing of water, we were ſanctified, how were we prophaned and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain laid common? I never yet could underſtand any divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; I am ſure it is much contrarie to Gods wonted me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and patience, to caſt off a people adhering to him, though ſubject to many aberrations and vile actions towards him; and the extraordinarie pleaſure of God is yet to be manifeſted: And if God count us <hi>holy,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the libertie of our acceſs to him in his Ordinance, they muſt produce a good commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that ſhall <hi>caſt us out, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and unclean,</hi> if they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:172229:117"/> we ſhould be therewithall contented. If Baptiſme doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate into the Church of God, doth it not intitle to all the priviledges of the Church, and binde us to uſe them, and the Church to allow us the uſe of them, according to our capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie? If we are baptized into one bodie, have we not the ſame relation to them that others have? Are we not all of one familie, members of one bodie, and brethren, ſonnes of the ſame father? Ought not all the Church to be the Paſtors charge? Is not the rebuke of the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly his duty, as well as his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of the orderly? Doth not Baptiſme ſo knit us one unto another, that we are bound to watch over one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and doe all brotherly du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?

To count the baptized <hi>dogges, men without,</hi> to diſown their <hi>brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi> and the like, muſt needs denie that Baptiſme is the dore of admiſſion into the Church, and yet this in terms they will not ſay, though they carrie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them <hi>as without,</hi> and call them to be members of the Church, who are members of the Church on as good a ground and as cleer a method as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: If this be not a ſoleciſme in Chriſtianitie, I know not how to make any. As for their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into the Church by <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, Agreement, or profeſſion,</hi> it is cleerly without <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

I confeſſe I have heard it often noted, that the difference between Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and others, is not ſo much as to maintain an irreconcileable diſtance: and I ſay ſo too: I could wiſh they were more friendliely united. As to the ſingle point of Diſcipline, they ſhall have my conſent for a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly toleration of its exerciſe, till they are weary of it. But as for their ſeparation from the Churches of Jeſus Chriſt, ſelf congregation into a Church, and ſecluſion of baptized ſouls, from ſacred Ordinances, and the like, they ſeem to me ſo repugnant to truth and order, and ruinous to Gods Church and Ordinances, that I cannot, without ſinne, but ſtand a profeſſed enemie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:172229:119"/> Let not men think that I allow the prophaneneſs of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, becauſe I alledge their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Covenant; or that I think their enjoyment may not be interrupted, becauſe I cannot conſent their intereſt be denied them.

Gods Ordinances we could bear, though never ſo croſs to our nature, becauſe thereunto we are bound by our Baptiſm; but the new wayes purſued by our brethren, and to us propoſed, are grievous to us, becauſe we finde them not in the grand Charter of our priviledge;
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:172229:121"/> willingly we would walk with God in duty, and draw nigh to him in the aſſemblies of his people, for that we are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto conſecrated; but herein we are debarred, and driven at a diſtance, as if <hi>Doggs, not Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Heathens, not Chriſtians, Aliens to the Covenant, not Heirs of Grace.</hi> If we goe aſtray, we think thoſe that are ſet over ought to ſeek us as ſheep, not ſuffer us to wander as goats. We have cauſe to complain, that our Shepheards <hi>feed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, not the flock; they feed the flock, and clothe them with the wooll; kill the fat, but feed not the ſheep: The weak they have not ſtrengthned, the ſick they have not healed, nor have they ſought that which was loſt, nor brought again, that which was driven away; but with cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie

Rule. <hi>All that will be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, ſaved, and enjoy the before noted priviledges, muſt be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</hi> All that will in an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way poſſeſs them (for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary providences are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reach of our debate) muſt be baptized: not only on the neceſſity of a command from God, but the nature of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, being the means appointed rightly conſtituted, and readily concluſive to ſuch an end: So that none unbaptized, can on any ground expect to enjoy, nor may warrantably be admitted to the priviledges of a ſanctified and ſaved people of the Lord.</p>

            <p n="1">1. Infant Baptiſme expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſin nature.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Explaineth the benefit of Relation, and the method of the Covenant, and eminently dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifyeth the children of ſuch pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>

            <p n="7">7. Encourageth under death.</p>
            <p>None of theſe doe ſo naturally flow from the baptiſme of men of grown yeeres, as wee ſhall plainly ſee by a particular conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of them.</p>
            <p>The firſt benefit by Infant-Baptiſme is, That it <hi>expreſſeth the ſin of nature, and engageth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it:</hi> Baptiſme doth it ſelf declare ſinne to bee <hi>defiling,</hi> but the <hi>ſpreading propertie</hi> thereof is evidenced by <hi>Infant-Baptiſme.</hi> They are <hi>waſhed,</hi> muſt needs wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they are <hi>uncleane;</hi> but <hi>their early Baptiſme,</hi> muſt needs note their uncleanneſſe is in <hi>their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> not in their perſons; for poor Babes, they have acted neyther good nor evill: That Babes muſt beare the paine of Circumciſion beſpeaks a foreskin upon their
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:172229:140" rendition="simple:additions"/> heart, that makes them prophane to God. The Baptiſme of men at yeeres, doth indeed minde them that they are filthy, but that is a filthineſs of their perſon, eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing that they having committed many actual corruptions, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to them: but that they are tranſgreſſors from the womb, conceived in ſin, and brought forth in iniquiry, of a prophane lump, and polluted in their very being; it no way at all convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, no, that is the language of the baptized before actuall ſin. The baptiſme and burial of our babes, hath ever been in the Church of God, two unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able arguments againſt the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagian fancie, that <hi>children have no imbred corruption, but ſin by imitation:</hi> If we give away the firſt, it is juſt God ſhould take away the ſecond, by giving us
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:172229:140"/> barren wombs. Infants Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme was urged by <hi>Auſtin</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Pelagius,</hi> to the puzling of him in his denyal of original ſinne: yet he never denyed them to be baptized, which had been a ready anſwer; nor was he ever able to withſtand the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: For if baptized before polluted in perſon, they muſt needs be unclean in nature; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore actual ſin paſs from them, original ſin muſt needs be upon them, before they are capable of any imitation, then they muſt needs be the ſubjects of imbred corruption: For Baptiſm cannot be denyed to be Gods Ordinance of Remiſſion and Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and further, this evidence of hereditarie ſin muſt needs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage <hi>hereditarie enmity,</hi> and ſo irreconcileable hatred, much more violent and implacable,

As ever you will make viſible the ſin of nature, baptize your babes before they be ſtained with actual guilt.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Benefit of Infant Baptiſme is, That it <hi>explaineth the benefit of Relation and the method of tranſmitting the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace.</hi> Baptiſme, as a ſeal of the Covenant, ſheweth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the Covenant, and the benefit of perſonall qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:172229:142"/> that fits for it; but it is the Infant ſeaſon, that ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>weth that God hath wiſely ordered <hi>Grace to run in natures channel,</hi> and parental relation, under ſuch a qualification <hi>as beleeving,</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender a propriety to Baptiſme. He that firſt receives the Patent of honour can diſcern no bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of relation, ſave what is fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but if his Patent be only perſonal, he ſeeth none at all: but hereditarie honours are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of relation and its advantage; hereby a man knows what his benefit is, in being <hi>the childe of a Baron or Earle,</hi> rather than of a <hi>common Knight or Gentleman.</hi> Baptiſme applied to men of years, doth indeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate a Covenant of Grace granted on good behaviour, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to every individual perſon; but wholly obliterateth the <hi>ſeeds</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:172229:143"/> and extent of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant unto <hi>natural Iſſue,</hi> in order to their good behaviour. It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth expreſly, that as to the ſpecialtie of Gods Grace, <hi>rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to beleeving Parents, is no priviledge:</hi> As good be the childe of <hi>Ammon,</hi> as of <hi>Abraham;</hi> of a Pagan, as a Chriſtian: which is cleerly contrarie to the tenure of the Covenant, <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed: The promiſe is to you and your children:</hi> and the ground of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the initiating ſeal, is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſuch Parents. Therefore every man-child at eight dayes old, ſhall be circumciſed, that thereby it may appear, the order of my Covenant is, to Parents beleeving and their ſeed, and the benefit of relation to ſuch Children, ſhall be, that <hi>I will be their God.</hi> Relation to the Olive,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:172229:143"/> is the reaſon of the branches fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: The Jews relation to their pious progenitors, is the only remaining hope of their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>They are beloved of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to election, for the fathers ſake, Rom.</hi> 11.28. If we will maintain the knowledge of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative advantages in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, carefully baptize we our Babes in their infancie, as the plaineſt comment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: ſo when they ſhall conſider themſelves to have been ſealed and ſanctified to God, before they had in themſelves the leaſt of perſonal qualification, they will bleſs God for the Covenant of their fathers, and the extent of it to the ſeed of beleevers, and giving them to be born of ſuch favorites to heaven. The great aſſertors of the Baptiſme of grown perſons, to defend their
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:172229:144"/> notion, doe in the miniſtration of Grace, darken all relation, and disfranchiſe all Poſterity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting the cleer text of Scripture, <hi>The promiſe is to you and your children,</hi> by a perſonal qualification, when <hi>God ſhall call them;</hi> as if the Holy Ghoſt had ſpoken nonſence, and uſed a term of relation in vain, and to no purpoſe: But certainly when God eſtabliſhed a Covenant of Grace, he did not invert natures courſe, but provided relation to derive the priviledges thereof in his Church, as well as other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages in the world; nor did he in the leaſt, intend Religion to be an abridgement of paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal right, and power of dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their ſeed to the ſervice of their God, as well as deſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to any worldly trade: and therefore he appointed a ſeal of
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:172229:144"/> his Covenant and ſacred Bond to his own ſervice, whereby ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects meerly paſſive (as was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore noted) might be at the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Parents to him preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And hereof Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, is the only viſible evidence in the whole world: Root and branches, Parents and Children, are alwaies homogeneal: Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture makes all relations to be of the ſame kinde; and Grace, not inverting Natures order, will have the children, <hi>by the dignity of a ſacred Ordinance, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared of the holy kinde,</hi> with their Parents; and by this religious badge of Baptiſme, be diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed from other Children of Turks, Jews, and Pagans, who like their Parents, remain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and eſtranged unto God. And thus Infant-Baptiſme, doth not only evidence relation and
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:172229:145"/> its benefit, the method and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Covenant <hi>to men within, but alſo to men without the Church,</hi> that it may be to them an encouragement, to lay hold on the Covenant of God, for that they doe not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for their own perſonal term, but ſee Grace alſo extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their iſſue, on the very ground of relation natural unto them, under a Chriſtian quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. And this is eſpecially profitable to the Jew, who having had the Covenant of God to themſelves and ſeed natural, as their ſeed, and that witneſſed by the initiating ſeal of Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſet in the fleſh of their children, muſt needs ſtumble at the new Covenant, if it exclude their iſſue, as hath been before noted: So that the Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, ſo cleerly witneſſing the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:172229:145"/> order of the Covenant and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of relation to beleeving Parents, to the comfort of men within the Church, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of men without the Church, it muſt needs be more profitable than the Baptiſme at grown years, which curtails the Covenant, cuts off Poſterity, caſts out of the Church, all rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion natural, and maketh all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations of Grace to be meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſonal.</p>
            <p>The third benefit of Infant Baptiſme is, That it <hi>enlargeth the bounds, and eſtabliſheth the being of the Church of God;</hi> but the baptiſme of grown men doth much confine the borders, and hazard the being of the Church. Infant Baptiſme doth enlarge the Church by the ſpreading of it through whole Families, Countries and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:172229:146"/> perſons are private and periſhing but poſterity is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique and flouriſhing; holy ſeede is the Churches nurſerie, whileſt grown trees are fading; Lambs are the increaſe of Chriſts Fold, when old-ſheep are few and dying, and ſucceſſion is the ſureſt title and ſtrongeſt ground of claime: when from genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to generation the Church of God is continued in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Race, from Father to Son, it is much eſtabliſhed againſt helliſh oppoſition. Nature hath made all living Creatures <hi>ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi> that they might multiply and continue: the courſe of providence is the ſame to the Church that it is to the World: certainly the only wiſe God well knew the beſt way to enlarge and eſtabliſh his owne kingdome upon Earth; and hee, though
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:172229:146" rendition="simple:additions"/> hee founded his Church in an old ſtock, yet order'd the ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it by naturall branches, and preſervation of it by poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie: The method of God muſt needs bee the ſame in the maintenance of his Church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the new, as it was under the old Teſtament, and hee that takes up his Church from one Nation, on deſigne to extend it through all the nations of the World, would never plant it only in perſonall periſhing plants, but provide for their ſcattering an holy-ſeede for its increaſe and ſucceſſion. The promiſe of the Churches increaſe in Goſpell times, is noted to be <hi>by Children;</hi> the promiſe is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xpreſſe, <hi>I will lift up my Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard to the Gentiles, and they ſhall bring thy ſonnes in their armes, and thy daughters on their
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:172229:147"/> ſhoulders, Iſa.</hi> 49.22. Our own obſervation muſt needs witneſſe the bounds of the Church is much enlarged by <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Baptiſme;</hi> more are inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to God by an early incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration to his Church, then their owne perſonall choice, for where wee ſee one man take up Chriſtianity ſo much as to the profeſſion of it, on terms of choyce, wee ſee hundreds enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged therein by parental profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and baptiſmall obligation in their infancy; if an eſſay here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were made in <hi>America,</hi> how ſmall would bee the number of them that ſhould own God and Chriſt, by being baptized in grown yeeres, and how nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous would they bee, by a time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dedication to God, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation to the Church by <hi>Infant Baptiſme?</hi> And again,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:172229:147"/> how many generations, each after other, hath ſucceeded in the Churches of God in our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but how ſoon will they be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, this Orchard be overſpread with the weeds of Atheiſme and Heatheniſme, if Anabaptiſts Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents doe proceede to breake off their branches from the Olive, and the line of the Covenant from their Poſteritie?</p>
            <p>The fourth benefit of Infant Baptiſme, <hi>It exciteth Repentance.</hi> Baptiſme in it ſelfe is hereunto an argument, but it is more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced from the ſeaſon of infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy than grown age; humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for paſt guilt, and future caution againſt ſin are much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced by the ſeaſon of our Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, and that by pointing out unto us the <hi>inclination of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and <hi>the kindneſſe of our God,</hi> both which, meeting with
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:172229:148"/> an ingenuous ſpirit, are very moving and melting conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; That wee are waſhed in water, doth witneſſe wee are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane; but in that we are waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Infant ſeaſon, before ſtained with the leaſt actual ſin and perſonal corruption, muſt needs witneſs, that <hi>in the day of our nativity our father was an Amorite, our mother an Hittite: we were polluted in our blood, our navel not cut; we were not waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor ſalted; no eye pitied us, but we were caſt out to the loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our perſons.</hi> If Baptiſme be an Ordinance of Remiſſion and Regeneration, it muſt needs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member its infant ſubjects, that in their nature there is <hi>guilt</hi> to be bewailed and pardoned, <hi>a foreskin</hi> to be violently cut off; <hi>a pravity</hi> unto evil, to be ſlain; <hi>an old man,</hi> to be crucified with
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:172229:148"/> Chriſt; <hi>a corrupt nature,</hi> to be watched againſt with all care and caution, and that not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by any <hi>perſonal act or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi> of our own, as Baptiſme at age imports; but (the more cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it is to conſider) it is <hi>imbred in nature,</hi> hereditarie to our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; therefore will more eaſily act in us, more cloſely adhere to us, and doth call for more care to keep it under: true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance alwayes reflects on the root of ſin, <hi>in iniquity was I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and in ſin did my mother bring me forth,</hi> is the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of penſive <hi>David,</hi> and hereunto Infant-Baptiſme doth plainly point us.</p>
            <p>This ſeaſon of our Baptiſme, doth not only acquaint us with our own vile nature, but alſo <hi>affect us with Gods kindneſs,</hi> that will melt the ingenuous ſoul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:172229:149"/> mourning and much care, not to offend; for the ſeaſon of our Baptiſme doth ſhew us <hi>Gods love to us,</hi> as he was the God of <hi>our fathers</hi> and the God of <hi>our youth,</hi> and both of them are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding aggravations of guilt. God often doth charge the ſin of <hi>Iſrael</hi> under the notion of <hi>forſaking the God of their fathers,</hi> and the pious in Scripture, did much enforce their humiliation, by the kindneſſes God did ſhew <hi>their fathers:</hi> And if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider our ſelves ſealed in infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie by Baptiſme, we muſt needs ſee God was the God of our fathers, and ſtruck Covenant with them, and was unto them gracious, otherwiſe we could not have been owned, as begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the Lord, and to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; and therefore the ſins we commit, is againſt our fathers,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:172229:149"/> friend, and God; nay they are againſt the <hi>God of our youth,</hi> that <hi>owned us</hi> in the day of our nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and in the loathing of our perſons, and ſaid unto us, Live; that took us as his own, ſware unto us, and entred into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with us in our very cradle, when we could not chooſe for our ſelves, and ſet the ſeale of his Covenant in our fleſh, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced us on the knees of his Church, brought us up at his own coſts, and nouriſhed us by his Ordinances, and hath been our God all our dayes. Oh! what aggravations of ſinne doth this kindneſs of God afford? How may the Miniſters of God ſpeak bitter things againſt them that daily break the Covenant of their youth, and deal unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the God of their fathers? Me thinks I ſhould heare ſome
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:172229:150"/> penſive ſoul ſitting on its ſtool of repentance, thus ſoaking its hard heart in its Infant-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, by ſuch ſerious contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations as theſe. <q>
                  <hi>I am bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed:</hi> then ſurely <hi>unclean</hi> guilt is on my ſoul; the body of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion poſſeſſeth me; if I be not pardoned, I periſh: If this old man be not <hi>buried with Chriſt in Baptiſme,</hi> I am undone. Muſt not the water of my bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, ſet the pump of my dry heart on running tears of contrition for this defiled e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of my perſon: <hi>of my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;</hi> that is not all; <hi>I was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in infancie,</hi> before I was in the leaſt capable of ſtaining my perſon. Oh wretched man! my very nature is defiled: how can I dream of drawing nigh to God, that am the pudled ſtream of a polluted fountain?
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:172229:150"/> Sinne is my natural temper, and guilt the very image of my father: <hi>In iniquity I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and in ſinne brought forth,</hi> how ſhall I be purged from this natural blemiſh, or withſtand this imbred corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? How am I neceſſitated to live in ſinne, for that it is naturalized to my very being? How eaſily muſt I needs be drawn to ſinfull action, whoſe very nature is <hi>ſinfull corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi> If ever I obtain pardon for, or power over my ſinne, it muſt needs be an act of eſpecial Grace, the benefit of a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Covenant: Sure I am, I can never ſufficienly lament this ſad eſtate of my nature. Many are the ſinfull actions which daily flow from this bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter root, and they ſink my ſoul into the depth of ſorrows,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:172229:151"/> when I ſeriouſly conſider my ſelf baptized: For hereby I ſee God, the God of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and the God of my youth, to have been the object of my offences, <hi>againſt thee, thee only have I offended;</hi> thee, the God of my father, to whom thou ſhewedſt favour, and called him out of darkneſs into thy marvellous light, with whom thou didſt eſtabliſh thy Covenant of Grace, and didſt extend it to his ſeed; and madeſt me, <hi>miſerable</hi> me, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of it, and ſo becameſt <hi>my God</hi> from my very being; thou ſaweſt me in the day of my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity; when I lay in my blood in the loathing of my perſon, thy eye pitied me, thou ſaid'ſt unto me, Live; thou ſpakeſt kindly unto me, ſwareſt to me, and entred'ſt into Covenant
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:172229:151"/> with me, and madeſt me thine own; layedſt me in the lap of thy Church, nouriſhedſt me by thine Ordinances: Thou by timely engaging me to thy ſelf, did'ſt prevent my wicked choice and Satan his malicious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of poſſeſſing me as a vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of his kingdome; all my dayes thou haſt done me good, yet <hi>wretched I,</hi> have ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch a God; <hi>ungratefull I,</hi> have been ready to forſake thee my God, and my fathers God, and have dealt falſly in thy Covenant. It might be juſt with thee, to deal with me as <hi>I have dealt with thee, when I deſpiſed the oath in breaking the Covenant;</hi> but in thy mercy, Lord, I pray thee, <hi>Remember thy Covenant thou madeſt to me in the dayes of my youth,</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh it for an everlaſting
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:172229:152"/> Covenant, that <hi>I may know the Lord,</hi> that I may remember and be aſhamed, and never o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen my mouth any more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of my ſhame, when thou art pacified towards me, for all that I have done againſt the God of my father, and the God of my youth: Now will I live in loyalty to ſo good a God, if thou wilt give me to be ſanctified by the blood of ſprinkling, and my old man to be crucified by Baptiſme, which by thy Grace ſhall be the awe of my ſoul and anſwer of my heart unto every temptation to ſin againſt thee.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This benefit cannot be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by adult Baptiſme, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords no ſuch matter of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, apprehending the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of God to be only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal, and therefore to be
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:172229:152"/> perſonally improved.</p>
            <p>The fifth Benefit of Infant-Baptiſme is, that it <hi>enforceth faith towards God.</hi> Baptiſme, as a ſeal of the promiſe, pledge of love, and ſanctifying Ordinance of God, is a ground of faith pleadable in prayer by all its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, but receiveth not a little force from the ſeaſon of its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication in infancie; whileſt it ſelf witneſſeth the Covenant it ſeals, the ſeaſon of its uſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth the extent of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to <hi>beleevers and their</hi> ſeed, and creates a ground, on which to claim protection, as well by <hi>early ſeizure,</hi> as <hi>covenant proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> not to note how all the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of God, in order to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and good things of this life, even <hi>all things pertaining to life and godlineſs,</hi> are aſſured to the ſoul by Baptiſme, as the ſeal of
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:172229:153"/> the Covenant. The Parent can with faith thus plead from the ſeaſon. <q>Lord, my childe is thine in Covenant, to thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, to thee dedicated, by thy ſeal on his fleſh: Oh! wilt thou own him: Remember him; take care of him; eſtabliſh thy Covenant with him; let all the graces of thy promiſe be performed to him; let not Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan ſeduce him from thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, to which he is ſo ſoon ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. How much doe I owe to thee, that makeſt Grace to run through Natures channel, <hi>my loins?</hi> Lord, let him in time know, and have faith to claim his intereſt: keep him from the property of prophane <hi>Eſau,</hi> that he deſpiſe not his birth-right in thy Covenant, which thou haſt ſealed to him in the ſight of thy people, by his bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</q>
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:172229:153"/> And as the Parent ſo the perſon baptized, acting faith in the Ordinance, doth thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force it from his Infant ſeaſon of enjoyment of it. <q>God is a gracious God, in calling my parents; he had reſpect unto my good, before I had a being; he graciouſly eſtabliſhed w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> them a Covenant, which he extended to their ſeed; I no ſooner ſprang from the womb, but he owned me as his own, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me by his name, and ſet the ſeal of his Covenant in my fleſh: as ſtudious to foreſtall the choice of my corrupt will <hi>(which would never have choſen him)</hi> he challenged me, and cauſed me to be dedicated to his ſervice, as ſenſible of Satans malice; he made an early ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zure of me, and ſet his mark upon me, and before there was
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:172229:154"/> in me the leaſt of act or quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; he ſanctified me to himſelf by the waſhing of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. What ever doubts may deter me, I will now draw nigh unto him, and depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him; for he that was ſo ſoon gracious in extending and ſealing to me the Covenant, will faithfully perform it: My condemnation will be moſt juſt, if I, having ſuch grounds of faith, ſhould be cut off by reaſon of unbelief: now I will walk before, and wait upon him; for he will not now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake me, or ſuffer Satan to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs me, and take me out of his houſe and family.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The ſixth Benefit of Infant-Baptiſme is, That <hi>it engageth more to duty,</hi> than adult Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. Herein it is of uſe to the <hi>Parent and baptized child.</hi> How
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:172229:154"/> much of argument doth Infant-Baptiſme preſs upon <hi>the Parent,</hi> to the due inſtruction and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his baptized child. Not to ſpeak any thing of the benefit of catechiſing it ſelf, the Parent hath reaſon to refl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ct the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of his child in its infant eſtate, to convince him, <q>That if God hath been ſo gracious to extend a Covenant of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his ſeed; he muſt have ſo much grace as to make them know Gods goodneſs, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the extent of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant: If God hath cauſed their loins to convey grace as well as ſinne, their care muſt be that the grace of God be not received in vain. The childs ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of intereſt in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded honours and priviledges, is the baſeneſs of education, and blot of natural affection: If by
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:172229:155"/> their Parental power they have dedicated them to Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt, it is their part to make them know to what they are devoted.</q> And as it bindes the Parents to the duty of education, ſo the child to carefull obſervation: Early adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the greateſt argument of filial obſervation that can be: the child taken off the Stall, is more bound to the will of Parents, than the man at years adopted to inherit; the one is the object of more pitie, ſubject of more care, coſt and charge, but of leſſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and obedience; therefore bound more to duty than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Infant-Baptiſm giveth cauſe to ſing with Iſrael, He is <hi>our God and our fathers God, we will exalt him, Exod.</hi> 15.2. and with <hi>David I am thy ſervant, the ſon of thy handmaid; I will offer ſacrifice,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:172229:155"/> and call upon thy name, Pſal.</hi> 116.16.17. We muſt not think as heirs of dignity to wear Gods livery in our cradles, but muſt know, it makes us alſo heirs of duty, to yeeld loyalty to him all our dayes. Parental dedication to God, layeth on us the duty of obſervation: Shall Parents pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim dayes of <hi>purim</hi> to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in all generations, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity dare to pretermit them? Whether we conſider Gods pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or our Parents power ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in our Infant-Baptiſm, both impoſe on us duty; &amp; the nature of our Baptiſm (the effect of both) binds us to fight at Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand under Chriſt his Banner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt every iniquity and vice, to the diſcharge of every duty of Religion; but neither faith nor obedience can be ſo enforced by the Baptiſme of grown perſons,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:172229:156"/> which deny relations natural to be of any uſe in things of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and doth greatly darken the method and order of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace and Salvation.</p>
            <p>The ſeventh and laſt Benefit of Infant-Baptiſme is, That it <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth under death;</hi> and that either the <hi>Child or Parents.</hi> We read in primitive times of Infant Martyrs, certainly they were thereunto prepared by a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their intereſt in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. In vain ſhould the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable mother encourage the ſcourged thirſty child, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>the cup of which Iſaac drank,</hi> and <hi>patiently to bear its preſent torments, for that it ſhould be ſhortly crowned with eternal glory,</hi> if the child at eight years of age had not underſtood the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God, and been catechiſed in its baptiſme. Our Anabaptiſts
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:172229:156"/> will never afford us <hi>babie Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,</hi> that will not allow us <hi>babie Chriſtians.</hi> And as for Parents, if their childrens intereſt in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and right to Baptiſme, doe not ſupport them under the death of their babes, I (a parent of dead children) doe demand, what can? That they are by nature <hi>children of wrath,</hi> muſt not be denyed; that they fall into a <hi>limbus Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> muſt be denyed by all that abhor Poperie: that they are ſaved there remains no hope, whileſt we ſee them out of the Ark of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. What unuſual way the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts run upon for their own comfort, they have not yet decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, nor will Scripture warrant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Were it not for Infants intereſt in the Covenant, ſealed in their Baptiſm, I ſhould mourn over my dead children, as without hope.</p>
            <p>You ſee now, that there is not only warrant in Scripture for the Baptiſme of your Infants, but there is much of profit by it. Whileſt others are beating the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:172229:157"/> controverſie, doe you ſtudy the practice of Infant-Baptiſme. Let not ſeducers beguile your ſimple ſouls, by pretending Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is <hi>unlawfull,</hi> becauſe <hi>unuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:</hi> But ſeeing there is ſo much profit in the Ordinance, and ſo much in the ſeaſon of its applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, prize it, purſue it, and preſerve it to the Church: Let your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren be <hi>baptized</hi> in their Infancie, and <hi>catechiſed</hi> according to their growing capacitie, that through ignorance they may not throw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their birth-right, but may du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know the duty and dignity thereof, and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mean themſelves as baptized ſouls.</p>
            <p>The fifth and laſt exhortation is to Church-gathering ſaints, <hi>To admit the baptized into the approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to God, in the aſſemblies of his people.</hi> Make no bar of diviſion to ſuch as we are the badge of union. If Baptiſme doe incorporate into the Church, and conſecrate unto God, why doe you deny the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the baptized, or their fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:172229:157"/> for divine ſervice? either deny Baptiſme to be the dore of admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into the Church of Chriſt, or throw down your <hi>Church Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant agreement or experiences of graces,</hi> as to entrance into a Church ſtate. Deny Baptiſme to be the Church conſtituting Bond, or talk not of gathering Churches from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong baptized ſouls: Affect not to your ſelves the terms and titles of <hi>ſaints, brethren, beleevers, Church,</hi> and the like, whil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> (by reaſon of your ſinfull ſchiſme) a better title thereunto than your ſelves. If Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme be the ground of confidence in acceſs to God, who are you that make it void? Is not the ſtraitning of the Church dore as dangerous as ſetting it wide open? Will it not be equally provoking to God to let <hi>doggs</hi> into his houſe, and to <hi>keep children out;</hi> to pollute his <hi>holy things</hi> by the unbaptized, and bar the baptized from <hi>his worſhip?</hi> If men baptized walk diſorderly, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor by diſcipline to reduce them:
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:172229:158"/> deny not their intereſt: drive them not from God: make it not your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne to paganize the Chriſtians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom you dwel, that ſome few of them may be brought into your Church-way. Weigh well the nature of Baptiſm, if it do not charge your way with wickedneſs, I know not how to judge. If Baptiſm rightly apprehended, be not the engine to batter Independencie, I dare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce my skil in militaries. Let not God ſay, draw neer in full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, having your bodies waſhed with pure water; and you ſay to your baptized Brethren, ſtand thou further from me, I am holier than thou.</p>
            <p>Thus then I have noted to you the nature of Baptiſme, the outward Ordinance, and the duties that flow from its conſecrating nature; which rightly underſtood, will convince much error, and correct many ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full practiſes: Which that it may doe, God, Father, Son, and holy Ghoſt, in whoſe holy Name we are baptized, follow it with his bleſſing. Amen.</p>
